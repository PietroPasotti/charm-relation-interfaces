# Interface tests

Charm relation interfaces are information exchange protocols for Juju charms.
In this repository, under each interface specification, it is possible to store a list of interface tests. The interface maintainers will write and maintain those tests for the interfaces they own. 
The goal of the interface tests is to determine whether a given charm satisfies an interface protocol.

There are two personas that need to work with interface tests: interface authors and interface users.
If you are an interface user, i.e. the owner of a charm that uses some of the interfaces specified in this repository, then you should look at the documentation in the [interface-tester-pytest](https://github.com/canonical/interface-tester-pytest) repository.

If you are an interface author, this page is for you.

# How-To write interface tests as an interface author

Throughout this example we will write some interface tests for the `ingress` interface.
This is the expected behaviour for the interface:
1) on `ingress-relation-joined`, the requirer should write its part of the data to the relation. 
2) on `ingress-relation-changed`, if the provider has written its part of the data to the relation, then the provider should publish its part of the data; otherwise it should publish no data.

## A minimal test case

### Register a charm to the interface
Write to `./interfaces/ingress/v0/charms.yaml`:

```yaml
providers:
  - name: traefik-k8s
    url: https://github.com/canonical/traefik-k8s-operator

requirers: []
```

Verify that the `charms.yaml` file format is correct:

`interface_tester discover --include ingress`

You should see:

```text
collecting tests from root = /home/pietro/canonical/charm-relation-interfaces...
Discovered:
ingress:
  - v1:
   - provider:
     - <no tests>
     - schema NOT OK
     - charms:
       - traefik-k8s (https://github.com/canonical/traefik-k8s-operator) custom_test_setup=no
   - requirer:
     - <no tests>
     - schema NOT OK
     - <no charms>
```

### Add a relation interface schema
Install the [interface tester package](https://github.com/canonical/interface-tester-pytest):

`pip install interface-tester-pytest`

Specify the schema for the `ingress` interface databags in `./interfaces/ingress/v0/schema.py`, for example:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from interface_tester import DataBagSchema

class MyRequirerUnitData(BaseModel):
    foo: str
    
class RequirerSchema(DataBagSchema):
    unit = MyRequirerUnitData()

class MyProviderAppData(BaseModel):
    bar: str
    baz: str
    
class ProviderSchema(DataBagSchema):
    app = MyProviderAppData()
```

Verify that the schemas are correctly specified:

`interface_tester discover --include ingress`

you should see:

```text
collecting tests from root = /home/pietro/canonical/charm-relation-interfaces...
Discovered:
ingress:
  - v1:
   - provider:
     - <no tests>
     - schema OK
     - charms:
       - traefik-k8s (https://github.com/canonical/traefik-k8s-operator) custom_test_setup=no
   - requirer:
     - <no tests>
     - schema OK
     - <no charms>
```

### Add interface tests
Create a python file at `<repo-root>/interfaces/ingress/v0/interface_tests/my_tests.py` with this content:

```python
from scenario import State
from interface_tester.interface_test import interface_test_case


@interface_test_case(
    event='ingress-relation-joined',
    role='requirer',
)
def test_data_published_on_joined(output_state: State):
    return
```

Verify that the tests are specified correctly:

`interface_tester discover --include ingress`

You should see:

```text
collecting tests from root = /home/pietro/canonical/charm-relation-interfaces...
Discovered:
ingress:
  - v1:
   - provider:
     - <no tests>
     - schema OK
     - charms:
       - traefik-k8s (https://github.com/canonical/traefik-k8s-operator) custom_test_setup=no
   - requirer:
      - test_data_published_on_joined:: ingress-relation-joined (state=no, schema=SchemaConfig.default)
     - schema OK
     - <no charms>
```


Run the test: 

`python run_matrix.py --include ingress`

You should see:

```json
{
  "ingress": {
    "v0": {
      "provider": {},
      "requirer": {
        "my-charm": true
      }
    }
  }
}

```


## Validating the output state

If the specification dictates something more than "the databag contents should match this schema in that event", for example:

> on `ingress-relation-joined`, the requirer should write its part of the data to the relation and set its status to Active.

The test would then become:

```python
from scenario import State
from interface_tester.interface_test import interface_test_case


@interface_test_case(
    event='ingress-relation-joined',
    role='requirer',
)
def test_data_published_on_joined(output_state: State):
    assert output_state.status.unit.name == 'active'
```


## Testing a negative

The second norm we have above contains a negative. We split it into two assertions to write the tests:

> on `ingress-relation-changed`, if the requirer has provided 'data' and 'baz' information in its relation databags, then the provider should publish its part of the data.
> on `ingress-relation-changed`, if the requirer has NOT provided 'data' and 'baz' information in its relation databags, then the provider should publish no data.

This becomes two test cases:

```python
from scenario import State, Relation
from interface_tester.interface_test import interface_test_case, SchemaConfig


@interface_test_case(
    event='ingress-relation-joined',
    role='provider',
    input_state=State(
        relations=[Relation(
            endpoint='foo',
            interface='ingress',
            remote_app_name='remote',  # this is our simulated requirer
            remote_app_data={
                'data': 'foo-bar',
                'baz': 'qux'
            }
        )]
    )
)
def test_data_published_on_joined_if_remote_has_sent_valid_data(output_state: State):
    """If the requirer has provided correct data, then the provider will populate its side of the databag."""

    
@interface_test_case(
    event='ingress-relation-joined',
    role='provider',
    schema=SchemaConfig.empty,
    input_state=State(
        relations=[Relation(
            endpoint='foo',
            interface='ingress',
            remote_app_name='remote',
            remote_app_data={
                'some': 'rubbish'
            }
        )]
    )
)
def test_no_data_published_on_joined_if_remote_has_not_sent_valid_data(output_state: State):
    """If the requirer has provided INcorrect data, then the provider will not write anything to its databags."""
```

Note the usage of `SchemaConfig.empty`. That is what disables the 'default' schema validation and instructs the test runner to verify that the provider-side databags are empty instead of containing whatever they should contain according to `schema.py`.  


# Reference: how does it work?
Each interface test maps to a [Scenario test](https://github.com/canonical/ops-scenario).

The metadata passed to `interface_test_case`, along with metadata gathered from the charm being tested, is used to assemble a scenario test. Once that is done, each interface test can be broken down in three steps, each one verifying separate things in order:

- verify that the scenario test runs (i.e. it can produce an output state without the charm raising exceptions)
- verify that the output state is valid (by the interface-test-writer's definition)
- validate the local relation databags against the role's relation schema provided in `schema.py`

If any of these steps fail, the test as a whole is considered failed.


## Configuring the schema to be used in an interface test
Interface tests work closely together with the `RequirerSchema|ProviderSchema` pydantic models supplied in `repo-root/interfaces/ingress/v0/schema.py`.
If your interface has a `schema.py`, you can check whether the schema is specified correctly or not by running `interface_tester discover`. You should see:

```yaml
ingress:
  - v0:
      - requirer:
          - tests:
              <...>
          - schema: OK
```

If it says `NOT OK`, there is an error in the schema format or the filename.

### Referencing the schema in an interface test
When you write an interface test for `ingress`, by default, the test case will validate the relation against the schema provider in `schema.py` (using the appropriate role).

`interface_tester.interface_test_case` accepts a `schema` argument that allows you to configure this behaviour. It can take one of four possible values:
- `interface_tester.interface_test.SchemaConfig.default` (or the string `"default"`): validate any `ingress` relation found in the `state_out` against the schema found in `schema.py`. If this interface test case is for the requirer, it will use the `RequirerSchema`; otherwise the `ProviderSchema`.
- `interface_tester.interface_test.SchemaConfig.skip` (or the string`"skip"`): skip schema validation for this test.
- `interface_tester.interface_test.SchemaConfig.empty` (or the string`"empty"`): assert that any `ingress` relation found in the `state_out` has **no relation data** at all (local side).
- you can pass a custom `interface_tester.schema_base.DataBagSchema` subclass, which will be used to validate any `ingress` relation found in `state_out`. This will replace the default one found in `schema.py` for this test only.


# Matrix-testing interface compliance
If we have:
- a `../interfaces/ingress/v0/charms.yaml` listing some providers and some requirers of the `ingress` interface.
- a `../interfaces/ingress/v0/schema.py` specifying the interface schema (optional: schema validation will be skipped if not found)
- a `../interfaces/ingress/v0/interface_tests/my_tests.py` providing a list of interface tests for either role

You can then run `python ./run_matrix.py ingress`.
This will attempt to run the interface tests on all charms in `.../interfaces/ingress/v0/charms.yaml`.
Omitting the `ingress` argument will run the tests for all interfaces (warning: might take some time.)
